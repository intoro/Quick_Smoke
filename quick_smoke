small cube is the smoke emitter the large cube is the domain
Scale up the domain. Select it and press s,  scale to desired size
With the domain still selected, from the physics tab increase the division resolution to 90 giving more detail to the smoke
Also check the smoke adaptive domain box - this limits the rendering to just the smoke speeding it up
check the Smoke High Resolution box - this acts as subdivision surface modifier for the smoke
